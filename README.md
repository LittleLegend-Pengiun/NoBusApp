# No Bus App (base on hpccbk/react-native-expo-redux-template)

### Important note

**MUST** install dependacies by yarn. Npm does not work!


Install yarn by using command
```
npm install --global yarn
```

Install all dependacies (Dev must be in the source code directory)
```bash
yarn install
```

After that, you can use npm to start the development process as usual!.
